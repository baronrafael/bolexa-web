# BolexaWeb

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.2.11.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Demo Happy Path

Use the `Demo` dropdown in the app header to keep the walkthrough deterministic.

1. Click `Reset demo data` to restore seeded data and switch back to the consumer user.
2. Open `Comprar ticket` and buy one General ticket for Caracas Music Fest.
3. Open `Mis tickets` to show the issued QR tickets.
4. Open `Scanner con QR` or copy `BLX-CMF-GEN-1001` from the demo dropdown.
5. Validate the QR, then mark entry to show duplicate-prevention behavior.
6. Open `Dashboard` to review organizer metrics.

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
